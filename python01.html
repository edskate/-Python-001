  <p>The  symbols that have a % first 🥇 are called placeholders. <br>
  The variables that go into these positions will be placed after the %  in the order where they are placed in the string 🧵. <br>
If you are doing just a single string, you will not need a wrapper, but if you do have <b>more than one </b> of these, you need to place them into a tuple, with a () enclosing it. <br>  The placeholder symbols will start with different  letters, depending mostly  on the variable type  you are using. <br> For example, the age is going to be an integer By the name is string .  <br>    All of these variable are going to be converted into the string before you can add them into the rest. </p>
