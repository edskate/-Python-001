  <h1>Triple Quotes</h1>
  <p> We have spent a bit of time talking about both single and double quotes, but
    there are times when you may need to bring in the triple quote.</p> <br>
  <p> This is used
    when you need to define a literal that will span many lines or one that already
    has a lot of quotes in it. <br>
    To do this, just use a single and double together or
    three singles. <br>
    The same rule applies with the triple quote as with all the others.
    You will need to star and end the phrase with the same one.
